# Class-Notes
This is where I will complete my class notes. I did not take many notes that day but will continue moving forward for reflection reasons. I know how to fork and clone a repo. You fork a repo by going to the repo then pressing fork in the top corner, which create a copy and clone is to your Github. Clonig is your own copy of another users respository.
